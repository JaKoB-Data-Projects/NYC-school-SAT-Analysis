# School SAT Analysis

This project analyzes NYC school SAT scores using Python and pandas. It covers how to:
- Identify top-performing schools in Math and overall SAT
- Calculate total SAT scores correctly
- Compare scores across boroughs and interpret variability

## Project Overview

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Data cleaning & wrangling
- Sorting and filtering data
- Grouped statistical analysis

**Dataset:**  
The analysis uses a dataset (`schools.csv`) containing school names, boroughs, and scores for Math, Reading, and Writing sections of the SAT.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Place `schools.csv` in the project folder.
3. Open and run `project1_school_sat_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Insights

- Which schools excel in Math SAT scores?
- What are the top 10 schools by total SAT?
- How do SAT scores vary by borough, and which borough shows the greatest diversity?

## Example Output

*(Include a cell/plot/table output if desired)*
